# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

As there are currently no projects in the pipeline I am respectfully expressing
a lack of need for vulnerability reports. That decision is dynamic, as should 
be expected. This policy is subject to change without notice until such a time 
when this security policy requires.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 5.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 5.0.x   | :x:                |
| 4.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 4.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Report them to me at another time when this repository will benefit from it. Fine - bobaboodle@gmail.com

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.
